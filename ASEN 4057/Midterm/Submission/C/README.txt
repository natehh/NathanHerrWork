README:
To compile the code in the command line, type the following:
gcc -o sort sort.c

To run option 1, type the following:
./sort 1 [integer]

To run option 2, type the following:
./sort 2, [filename]

To batch sort, type the following:
. run_sort.sh Herr/Midterm/Submission/C

Note: Something is wrong with my C code where a file with
vertically arranged integers has memory issues. It works
with a horizontally arranged file, and I'm not sure why.
